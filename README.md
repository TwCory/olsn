Coralt - Open Large-Scale Network (OLSN) Project
================================================

Previously dubbed my "InfiniRoute" project, while still using the base "Coralt" name
to name my projects, as I wanted to have something with a unique name, my "OLSN"
project is meant to serve as a fully free and open-source network OS, with similarities
in actual usage and configuration to that of Cisco IOS, and with a feature support
matrix most similar to that seen in NOS solutions like VyOS and OpenWRT.

This network system currently uses a Debian GNU/Linux system as the base OS, with most
of the services, features, protocols, etc.. being almost entirely developed from the
ground up, while utilizing the Linux kernel's networking subsystem for most lower-level
protocols and forwarding services.
